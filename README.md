# metricsFortran
The Fortran: metricsFortran contains subroutines in Fortran for estimating econometric models. The import of this project lies in exposing the numerical and computational dimensions to econometric and statistical modelling, with the intention of increasing performance, efficiency, and offering a grasp at programming algorithms at basic levels for common econometric models.

Due to the availability of high-level functionalities in Fortran viz. matrix product, transpose, etc., we do not provide code for executing such tasks.
